At World of Plants our goal is to provide a fun and educational web site with lots of interesting content. We try to write articles that are informative, easy to read, and add interesting images and videos.

<br>
<br>

We hope to provide an informative place for children of elementary school ages to learn, explore, and use the internet for research.

Plants are really important for the planet and for all living things. Therefore, the goal is to spread more knowledge about plants. We tend to forget the importance of plants and often take them for granted. 

<br>
<br>

People may think that there is nothing much to the plants and trees that are around us every day but they are vital for life and our long-term survival. 

<br>
<br>

Plants are an essential resource; we rely on them for food, water, medicine, the air we breathe, habitat and our climate. In addition to all of these benefits they are important for our wellbeing.
